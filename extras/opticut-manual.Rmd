# Introduction

Identifying and monitoring indicator species has long been considered a cost-effective way of tracking environmental change or the status of the biota. Examples include the characterization of vegetation types (Chytry et al. 2002), degradation of ecosystems (McGeoch & Chown 1988), or signalling cryptic or rare species (Halme et al. 2009). Throughout these examples, a key attribute of indicator species (also referred to as character or differential species) is that they have strong associations with the environmental variables that they are supposed to indicate.

Approaches to quantify the degree of environmental associations for species (indicator value) traditionally falls into three major types of approaches:

1. contingency table based measures (De Caceres & Legendre 2009); 
2. analysis of variance (ANOVA; Wildi & Feldmeyer-Christe 2013); and 
3. the widely used non-parametric IndVal method (Dufrene & Legendre 1997). 

While the different approaches have strong appeal and applications, they do not always meet the challenges presented by ecological data. 

Ecological data come in different forms: binary, ordinal, count, abundance, or presence only data. Some of these data types are suitable for a particular approach, while some formats need 'tweaking'. For example, binarizing abundance or count data for contingency tables leads to information loss. ANOVA, on the other hand, implies normality and homoscedastic errors, which might not always be satisfied by 0/1, ordinal, skewed, or percent cover data. Finally, randomization test for the IndVal approach requires count data, which renders hypothesis testing difficult if not impossible for continuous or ordinal data.

Another staple of observation field studies is the presence of modifying or confounding variables, or the presence of systematic biases (variable sampling effort, imperfect detectability, sample selection bias). Ignoring these effects can lead to erroneous indicator species analysis (Zettler et al. 2013). Controlling for these effects can improve the assessment of species-environment relationships, thus lead to better evaluation of indicator species. 

To address these limitations, Kemencei et al. (2014) proposed a model-based indicator species analysis that accounted for the effects of modifying variables, and non-independence in the data due to paired sampling design. This model-based approach has been generalized and made available in the opticut R extension package. The opticut package offers computationally efficient and extensible algorithms for finding indicator species, tools for exploring and visualizing the results, and quantifying uncertainties. This manual showcases the functionality of the package.

# Patritioning

Optimal partitioning (optimal cut, or in short: opticut) is found for each species independent of each other. We make observations ($y_i$) of possibly multiple species at $i=1,...,n$ sites. Now let us consider a discrete site descriptor ($g_i$) with $K$ levels or strata ($k=1,\ldots,K; K>2$). This stratification might come from remotely sensed or other geospatial information, field measurements, or from multivariate clustering. We can use $g_i$ to create $m=1,...,M$ possible binary partitions based on coding one or more levels as 1s and the rest with 0s. We denote any such possible partition as $z^{(m)}$. The total number of binary partitions is $M=2^{K-1}-1$, not counting cases when 0s or 1s are completely missing (which is the null model). The opticut method, as opposed to for example IndVal method is invariant to the coding of 0s and 1s in $z^{(m)}$. This means that complementary cases, such as $z^{(m)}$ and $1-z^{(m)}$, are treated as interchangeable. The opticut package provides utility functions to create and check binary partitions from multi-level vectors (`kComb`, `allComb`, `checkComb`). 

## Manipulating partitions

Finding all combinations does not require a model or observed responses.
It only takes a classification vector with $K > 1$ strata.
The `kComb` function returns a 'contrast' matrix corresponding to
all possible binary partitions of the factor with $K$ levels:

```{r}
kComb(k = 2)
kComb(k = 3)
kComb(k = 4)
```

`allComb` takes a classification vector with at least 2 levels
and returns a model matrix with binary partitions. `checkComb`
checks if combinations are unique and non-complementary
(misfits are returned as attributes):

```{r}
## finding all combinations
(f <- rep(LETTERS[1:4], each=2))
(mc <- allComb(f, collapse = "_"))
## checking for complementary entries
checkComb(mc) # TRUE
## adding complementary entries to the matrix
mc2 <- cbind(z = 1 - mc[,1], mc[,c(1:ncol(mc), 1)])
colnames(mc2) <- 1:ncol(mc2)
mc2
checkComb(mc2) # FALSE
```

## Choosing a parametric model

A suitable parametric (or semi-parametric) model can be chosen to describe the relationship between the observations for a single species and the site descriptors. The choice of the parametric model depends on the nature of the observations and the goals of the study. The systematic component of the model (also called the linear predictor), $f(\mu_i)=\beta_0^{(m)}+\beta_1^{(m)} z_i^{(m)}+\sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_j^{(m)} x_{ij}$  x_ij, is linked to the random component of the model through the link function $f$. The expected value is given by the inverse link function: $E[Y_i]=\mu_i=f^{-1}(\beta_0^{(m)}+\beta_1^{(m)} z_i^{(m)}+\sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_j^{(m)} x_{ij})$. Expected values can then be estimated for each partition. The symbol $x_{ij}$ denotes other site descriptors ($j=1,...,p$; number of predictors besides $g_i$) that can take discrete or continuous values. These variables might describe variation in the observations not fully explained by the partitions, e.g. due to spatially uneven distribution, differences in sampling effort, or environmental variables interfering with the observation process.

We can estimate the parameters in the linear predictor (and possibly other "nuisance"" factors such as variance components in mixed effects models) and calculate expected values. The probability density function for the model $P(Y_i=y_i \mid z_i^{(m)},x_{ij},\theta)$ is used to find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the model parameters $\hat{\theta}^{(m)}=(\hat{\beta}_0^{(m)},\hat{\beta}_1^{(m)},\hat{\alpha}_1^{(m)},\ldots,\hat{\alpha}_p^{(m)})$ that jointly maximize the log-likelihood function. The log-likelihood function evaluated at the MLE is $l(\hat{\theta}^{(m)}; y)$. 

The opticut package has several built-in distributions that can be specified though the `dist` argument. 
Currently available distributions:

* `"gaussian"`: real valued continuous observations, e.g. biomass;
* `"poisson"`: Poisson count data;
* `"binomial"`: presence-absence type data;
* `"negbin"`: overdispersed Negative Binomial count data;
* `"beta"`: continuous response in the unit interval, e.g. percent cover;
* `"zip"`, `"zip2"`: zero-inflated Poisson counts (partitioning in count model:
  `"zip"`, or in zero model: `"zip2"`);
* `"zinb"`, `"zinb2"`: zero-inflated Negative Binomial counts (partitioning in count model: `"zinb"`, or in zero model: `"zinb2"`);
* `"rsf"`, `"rspf"`: presence-only data using resource selection and resource selection probability functions (only available for single species because used distribution is unique for all species thus multiple species cannot be combined in a single input matrix).

Other distributions can be specified by user-defined functions as explained later in the manual.

## All combinations

Fitting the model to all the M candidate binary partitions leads to a set of log-likelihood values. One can compare the log-likelihood values $l(\hat{\theta}^{(m)}; y)$) to the log-likelihood value based on the null model $l(\hat{\theta}^{(0)}; y)$. We define the null model the same way as the other $M$ models but without the binary partition: $\beta_1^{(m)}=0$. The log of the likelihood ratio between the M candidate models and the null model can be calculated as $l(\hat{\theta}^{(m)}; y)-l(\hat{\theta}^{(0)}; y)$).

The best-supported model $m'$ and the corresponding binary partition $z^{(m')}$ is the model with the highest log-likelihood ratio value $l(\hat{\theta}^{(m')}; y)$. Model weights are calculated as $w_m=exp\{l(\hat{\theta}^{(m)}; y)-l(\hat{\theta}^{(m')}; y)\} / \sum_{m=1}^{M} exp\{l(\hat{\theta}^{(m)}; y)-l(\hat{\theta}^{(m')}; y)\}$. These weights sum to 1 and indicate asymptotic probabilities of finding the same best partition when the sampling is replicated. The concentration of asymptotic probabilities among the models can be expressed through the Simpson index $H=\sum_{m=1}^{M} w_{m}^2$. High values of $H$ indicate high concentration of the model weights for one or few model out of the total number of models compared (Kemencei et al. 2014).

The opticut package provides the `opticut1` function to fit a chosen parametric model to a set of binary partitions and the summary returns the model output for each candidate partition with log likelihood ratios and model weights. 

```{r}
## stratification
g <- c(1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3)
## abundance
y <- c(0,0,3,0, 2,3,0,5, 5,6,3,4)
mods <- opticut1(Y = y, Z = allComb(g), dist = "gaussian")
mods
```

Not all the models are printed, only the ones where the log likelihood ratio (`logLR`) value is $\geq2$ by default. We can change this by
explicitly defining the `cut` argument in the `print` method (or by setting the `cut` global option via `ocoptions`, as explained later):

```{r}
print(mods, cut = -Inf)
```

Model support across the partitions can be visualized by the model weight plot (`wplot`):

```{r}
wplot(mods, cut = -Inf)
```

The `opticut` function can take matrices or a model formula as its input, and repeats the procedure done by opticut1 for multiple species in a community matrix. The summary shows the best-supported model for each species. It is the preferred way of specifying the model for single species as well.
Single species results are part of the `$species` element of the output object:


```{r}
(oc <- opticut(y, strata = g, comb = "all", dist = "gaussian"))
summary(oc)
oc$species
```

The use of the `opticut1` function is generally discouraged: some of the internal checks are not guaranteed to flag issues when the formula-to-model-matrix translation is side-stepped (this is what is happening when the modifier variables are supplied as `X` argument in `opticut1`). Use the `opticut` with a single species instead, as shown above.

## Indicator value

Once a model is fit a to a given binary partition, we can quantify the indicator value for the species. The indicator value denoted by $I^{(m)}$ describes the contrast between the two subset of the data represented by the binary partition $z^{(m)}$. We define indicator value as a scaled version of the $\beta_1^{(m)}$ coefficient estimate: $I^{(m)}= \mid tanh(c\beta_1^{(m)}) \mid$, where $c=0.5$. The hyperbolic tangent function is used as an inverse Fisher transformation to scale real valued coefficients into the [-1,1] range. The absolute value then results in a [0, 1] range for the indicator value. 

The $c$ is a scaling constant that modifies the shape of the function. We chose 0.5 as the default value that allows the indicator value to change more gradually according to our experience with real-world data sets. The $c=0.5$ setting is also identical to an inverse logistic function transformed into the [-1, 1] range. 

The `beta2i` function is used internally to calculate the indicator value.
Here we show the effect of the scaling constant $c$ on the shape of the
function, the default $c=0.5$ is in green:

```{r}
beta <- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)
Col <- occolors(c("red", "blue"))(10)
Col[6] <- "#00FF00"
plot(beta, beta2i(beta), type = "n")
s <- seq(1, 0.1, -0.1)
for (i in 1:10) {
    lines(beta, beta2i(beta, scale = s[i]), col = Col[i])
    text(1.5 - 0.2, beta2i(1.5, scale = s[i]), s[i], col = Col[i])
}
```

An alternative way to define the indicator value would be taking the relative difference between the expected values for the 0 and 1 stratum in $z^{(m)}$. This, however, depends on the response scale and the baseline values chosen for possible modifying effects.

Our definition of indicator value is on the linear predictor scale and is more readily compared across species without respect to their relative abundance and values of other modifying factors. Note however, that the meaning of the indicator value might be quite different for studies using different parametric models: it is a difference in the Gaussian case, multiplier in log-linear models, change in log-odds in logistic or ordinal regression. The indicator value given a binary partition is returned by the model summaries, and used in visualization:

```{r}
plot(oc)
```

Use the `ocoptions` function to change the default `scale` ($c$) setting.

## User defined combinations

It is possible to

```{r}
comb <- cbind(
    A = c(rep(1, 4), rep(0, 8)),
    B = c(rep(0, 4), rep(1, 4), rep(0, 4)))
comb
print(opticut1(Y = y, Z = comb, dist = "gaussian"), cut = -Inf)
```

If the user happen to define complementary partitions, an error
message is thrown:

```{r}
comb <- cbind(comb, 1-comb)
colnames(comb) <- LETTERS[1:4]
comb
try(opticut1(Y = y, Z = comb, dist = "gaussian"))
checkComb(comb)
```

The global option `check_comb` can be set to override this default behavior,
although there is no real point in duplicating reparametrized
but otherwise identical models:

```{r}
op <- ocoptions(check_comb = FALSE, cut = -Inf)
opticut1(Y = y, Z = comb, dist = "gaussian")
ocoptions(op)
```

## Rank based combinations

The IndVal method requires the algorithm to evaluate $2^K-1$ binary partitions. Our opticut approach is parametrization invariant with respect to coding the levels in the binary partitions (it affects the intercept term but not the contrast or the log likelihood ratio). This effectively halves the number of partitions we need to compare ($2^{K-1}-1$, `comb = "all"` in opticut). Still, the number of partitions increases according to powers of 2. Here we propose an approach that increases linearly with $K$. This algorithm is based on sorting all the $K$ partitions in $g$ according to increasing order of the linear predictor estimates for $K$ coefficients (as opposed to estimating 2 coefficients for a binary partition). The logic follows from the fact that the optimal binary partitioning tries to find the best split in terms of likelihood ratio with lower estimates on one side, and higher estimates on the other side of the split. As a consequence, we only need to try $K-1$ binary partitions to find the optimal $z^{(m')}$. This algorithm is implemented in the `rankComb` function that is called by opticut with the argument `comb = "rank"`.

The function `rankComb` evaluates a model with a $K$-level factor
and returns a corresponding partitioning matrix. Attributes
hold the estimates for the $K$ levels:

```{r}
rankComb(Y = y, Z = as.factor(g), dist = "gaussian", collapse = "_")
```

The `collapse` argument can be important to make partitions more distinguishable.
The global option is `" "` that can be modified via the `ocoptions` function.
It can cause problems when the the `collapse` character is part
of the factor levels used for $g$. The `fix_levels` function comes handy
for fixing these levels. The function replaces the `collapse` character
to something else:

```{r}
getOption("ocoptions")$collapse
fix_levels(as.factor(c("A b", "C d")), sep=":")
fix_levels(as.factor(c("A b", "C d")), sep="")
```

There is an overhead of fitting the model to calculate the ranking first. But computing efficiencies can be still high compared to all partitions. As a consequence of the ranking process, we do not have summaries for all the possible binary partitions, only for the top candidates. Moreover, the partitions produced for each species might not be identical. Therefore the model weights ($w$) and Simpson index ($H$) have different interpretation and cannot be that easily compared across species, unless the model weights are highly concentrated for the top models. In this case, the sum of weights for the missing models becomes negligible. Another consequence of the ranking process is that $\beta_1^{(m)}$ estimates are always positive. In the case of comparing all the partitions, the full set of partitions is fixed for all species, and some respond positively while others respond negatively to the same binary variable in terms of the $\beta_1^{(m)}$ values. Thus it is required to store the sign of the relationship as part of the summary. 

The `comb = "rank"` is the default setting in `opticut`. It is clear
that the 2 approaches lead to identical best partitions.
Only the model weights ($w$) are different:

```{r}
summary(opticut(y, strata = g, comb = "all", dist = "gaussian"))
summary(opticut(y, strata = g, comb = "rank", dist = "gaussian"))
```

Here is how the ranking info is turned into binary partitions internally:

```{r}
## simulate some data
set.seed(1234)
n <- 200
x0 <- sample(1:4, n, TRUE)
x1 <- ifelse(x0 %in% 1:2, 1, 0)
x2 <- rnorm(n, 0.5, 1)
lam <- exp(0.5 + 0.5*x1 + -0.2*x2)
Y <- rpois(n, lam)

## binary partitions
head(rc <- rankComb(Y, model.matrix(~x2), as.factor(x0), dist="poisson"))
attr(rc, "est") # expected values in factor levels
aggregate(exp(0.5 + 0.5*x1), list(x0=x0), mean) # true values

## simple example
oComb(1:4, "+")
## using estimates
oComb(attr(rc, "est"))
```

## Partitioning for multiple species

The `opticut` function can take matrices or a model formula as its input, and repeats the procedure done by `opticut1` for multiple species in a community matrix. The summary shows the best-supported model for each species,
in this case based on a Poisson count model (`dist = "poisson"`). 
The `plot` method uses the indicator value (`I` in the summary) to represent
the contrast between the two strata of the best supported binary partition:

```{r}
## stratification
g <-    c(1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3)

## community matrix
y <- cbind(
    Sp1=c(4,6,3,5, 5,6,3,4, 4,1,3,2),
    Sp2=c(0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,1, 4,2,3,4),
    Sp3=c(0,0,3,0, 2,3,0,5, 5,6,3,4))

oc <- opticut(formula = y ~ 1, strata = g, dist = "poisson", comb = "all")
summary(oc)

plot(oc, cut = -Inf)
```

Model support across the partitions can be visualized by the model weight plot (`wplot`). 

```{r}
wplot(oc, cut = -Inf)
```

Note that the `wplot`  uses 'splits' (binary partitions) 
whereas `plot` uses the $K$ levels. Therefore, `wplot` does not work for multiple
species when `comb = "rank"`. In this case the splits can be different 
across the species, whereas `comb = "all"` uses the
same pre-defined partitions across all species.

Compare the `"all"` and `"rank"` based combinations: same best partitions
putting aside complementaryity

```{r}
op <- ocoptions(cut = -Inf)
summary(opticut(formula = y ~ 1, strata = g, dist = "poisson", comb = "all"))
summary(opticut(formula = y ~ 1, strata = g, dist = "poisson", comb = "rank"))
ocoptions(op)
```

## Accessing models and partitions

The `bestmodel` method returns the best-supported model for further model diagnostics and prediction, the `getMLE` prints out the estimated
coefficients and the variance-covariance matrix:

```{r}
mods <- bestmodel(oc)
mods
## explore further
str(predict(mods[[1]]))
confint(mods[[1]])

## MLE and variance-covariance matrix (species 1)
getMLE(oc, which = 1)
```

The `bestpart` method returns the binary partition for the best-supported model:

```{r}
bestpart(oc)
```


## Quantifying uncertainty

Uncertainty in the estimated coefficients and uncertainty in the derived indicator value for the best-supported model ($I^{(m')}$) is quantified based on the estimate of the Hessian matrix assuming asymptotic normality of the MLE. The distribution of $I^{(m')}$ in this case is based on parametric bootstrap. This approach (`type = "asymp"` in `uncertainty`) is suitable when asymptotic normality assumption is reasonable, i.e. sample size is large. For small sample situations, a non-parametric bootstrap algorithm is implemented (`type = "boot"`) to estimate uncertainty in $I^{(m')}$. The summary contains lower and upper confidence limits (for a given error rate) representing the asymptotic or bootstrap distribution (based on $B$ number of iterations) given the fixed partition for the best model, $z^{(m')}$.

The output is summarized, the `$uncertainty` component contains individual species results:

```{r}
g <-    c(1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3)

y <- cbind(
    Sp1=c(4,6,3,5, 5,6,3,4, 4,1,3,2),
    Sp2=c(0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,1, 4,2,3,4),
    Sp3=c(0,0,3,0, 2,3,0,5, 5,6,3,4))

oc <- opticut(formula = y ~ 1, strata = g, dist = "poisson")

uc <- uncertainty(oc, type = "asymp", B = 999)
summary(uc)
uc$uncertainty
```

The bootstrap can be difficult for small sample sizes, strata can go completely missing:

```{r}
try(uc <- uncertainty(oc, type = "boot", B = 99))
```

A general requirement for the bootstrap approach (`"boot"` and `"multi"`) is that the bootstrap samples contain observations from each stratum. We recommend having at least 5 observations per strata. Possible problems with missing partitions in small data sets can be remedied by supplying pre-defined indices for resampling, for example, based on jackknife (leave-one-out) approach. The resampling scheme can be customized for such needs. Use the `check_strata` function:

```{r}
B <- sapply(1:length(g), function(i) which((1:length(g)) != i))
check_strata(oc, B) # check representation
summary(uncertainty(oc, type = "boot", B = B))
```

The reliability of the best partition can also be assessed using the setting `type = "multi"` (as in *multi*ple models). In this case, the model partitions are re-evaluated for each bootstrap sample. Model uncertainty is assessed as the number of times a partition is supported out of the $B$ bootstrap runs ($b=1,\ldots,B$). The reliability ($R$) metric in the summary is the proportion for the most frequently supported partition. The corresponding indicator value and confidence interval is conditional on this most commonly supported partition.

```{r}
summary(ucm <- uncertainty(oc, type = "multi", B = B))
```

The `bestpart` method returns the selection frequencies for the best-supported models (based on `type = "multi"` with `comb = "rank"`):

```{r}
bestpart(ucm)
```

The bootstrap averaged ('bagged') expected values for each $k=1,\ldots,K$ stratum in $g$ can be accessed using the `bsmooth` method that calculates $E[Y_i \mid g_i = k] = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} f^{-1}({}^{(b)}\hat{\beta}_0^{(m')} + {}^{(b)}\hat{\beta}_1^{(m')} {}^{(b)}z_i^{(m')})$:

```{r}
bsmooth(ucm)
```

# Distributions

For most distributions, we will use the `dolina` data set that is part of the **opticut** package. It is a comprehensive and micro-scale land snail data set from 16 dolines of the Aggtelek Karst Area, Hungary. Data set containing land snail counts as described in Kemecei et al. 2014.

```{r}
data(dolina)
## stratum as ordinal
dolina$samp$stratum <- as.integer(dolina$samp$stratum)
## filter species to speed up things a bit
Y <- dolina$xtab[,colSums(dolina$xtab > 0) >= 20]
```

## Real valued data: Gaussian

```{r}
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="gaussian")
summary(dol)

## vertical plot orientation
plot(dol, horizontal=FALSE, pos=1, upper=0.8)
```

## Nonnegative counts: Poisson and Negative Binomial

```{r}
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="poisson")
summary(dol)

## horizontal plot orientation
plot(dol)
```

Because `opticut` uses the `stats::glm` function to fit the Poisson model, it accepts other arguments, e.g. offsets. Let's subset the `dolina`
data set for the litter sampling method (`"Q"`). Pool the abundances
in each of the 16 dolines by microhabitat types. By doing this,
we make sampling effort uneven. Litter microhabitat was sampled along
a North-South transect (7 locations), whereas the other three strata 
(rock, live trees, dead wood) were sampled at 3 random locations in each dolina.

```{r}
DQ <- dolina$samp[dolina$samp$method == "Q",]
DQ$dol_mhab <- paste0(DQ$dolina, "_", DQ$mhab)
head(DQ)
YQ <- dolina$xtab[dolina$samp$method == "Q",]
YQ <- YQ[,colSums(YQ > 0) >= 20]
YQ <- mefa4::groupSums(YQ, 1, DQ$dol_mhab)
DQ <- mefa4::nonDuplicated(DQ, dol_mhab, TRUE)
```

Let's compare the results of ignoring sampling effort differences
with a case when we use sampling effort as offset.
Offsets are defined as `log(7)` or `log(3)` representing
the sampling volume differences (more debris searched leads to more snails found).
Using offsets results in less species that is associated with litter:

```{r}
op <- ocoptions(collapse="_", sort=FALSE, cut=-Inf)
dol0 <- opticut(YQ, strata=DQ$mhab, dist="poisson")
off <- ifelse(DQ$mhab == "LI", log(7), log(3))
dol1 <- opticut(YQ, strata=DQ$mhab, dist="poisson", offset=off)
table(wo_offset=summary(dol0)$summary$split,
    with_offset=summary(dol1)$summary$split)
ocoptions(op)
opar <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(dol0, show_I=FALSE, show_S=FALSE, sort=FALSE, cex.axis=0.6)
plot(dol1, show_I=FALSE, show_S=FALSE, sort=FALSE, cex.axis=0.6)
par(opar)
```

The Negative Binomial model can be quite picky, as it gives an error
somewhere in the middle of the process:

```{r}
try(dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="negbin"))
```

Changing the `try_error` global option will allow the process to go on
after catching the error:

```{r}
op <- ocoptions(try_error = TRUE)
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="negbin")
dol$failed
ocoptions(op)
```

It failed for the `"mbor"` (*Macrogastra borealis*) species, which is now excluded from the output.


## Zero-inflated count distributions

The Zero-inflated Negative Binomial implementation in the **pscl** package
seems more robust, no error messages. We use the `dist = "zinb2"` option
so that we test for optimal partitioning in the zero-inflation (ZI) component.
Using a mixture distribution can be important if 0s can occur not only
as a result of the ZI component, but due to low abundance in the count distribution (Poisson or Negative Binomial). Differentiating among these different types of zeros is not possible by binarizing the data and using logistic regression.

In the case of `"zip2"` and `"zinb2"` distributions, the coefficients
refer to the probability of non-zero, so that positive and negative effects are
properly identified (as opposed to `"zip"` and `"zinb"` where the ZI 
coefficients refer to probability of zero):

```{r}
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="zinb2")
plot(dol)
```


## Presence-absence data: Binomial

The following example uses the dolina data set and illustrates how the link function can be specified in the Binomial case:

```{r warning=FALSE}
## dolina example
data(dolina)
## stratum as ordinal
dolina$samp$stratum <- as.integer(dolina$samp$stratum)
## filter species to speed up things a bit
Y <- ifelse(dolina$xtab[,colSums(dolina$xtab > 0) >= 20] > 0, 1, 0)
## opticut results, note the cloglog link function
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="binomial:cloglog")

## parallel computing for uncertainty
ucdol <- uncertainty(dol, type="multi", B=25)

bestpart(ucdol)
heatmap(t(bestpart(ucdol)), scale="none", col=occolors()(25),
    distfun=function(x) dist(x, "manhattan"))

## See how indicator value changes with different partitions
with(ucdol$uncertainty[["pvic"]],
    boxplot(I ~ best, col="gold", ylab="Indicator value"))
```

## Percent cover data: Binomial and Beta distribution

The data we are using is from the **rioja** package (Juggins 2015)
is pollen stratigraphic data from Abernethy Forest, Scotland, spanning approximately 5500--12100 BP (from Birks & Mathews 1978).

```{r}
library(rioja)
data(aber)
strat.plot(aber$spec, aber$ages$Depth, scale.percent=TRUE, y.rev=TRUE)
```

We use the Beta distribution for the stratigraphy example. 
The only limitation of the Beta distribution in this context is that boundary values (0 and 1) are not part of the support. One can use a tiny value (e.g. 0.0001). We are going to focus on species with at least 5 percent maximum values in the data set.

```{r}
z <- as.factor(cut(aber$ages$Depth, 5))
ab <- as.matrix(aber$spec) / 100
ab[ab == 0] <- 0.0001
ab <- ab[,apply(ab, 2, max) > 0.05]

a <- opticut(ab, strata=z, comb="rank", dist="beta")
summary(a)
```

The plot shows results in a vertical orientation, resembling the stratigraphy plot.

```{r}
plot(a, sort=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE, pos=1, upper=0.8,
    show_I=FALSE, show_S=FALSE, mar=c(6,6,1,1), xlab="", ylab="")
```

Let us combine together the best partitions with the raw data:

```{r}
bp <- bestpart(a)
opar <- par(mfrow=c(3,4), mar=c(2,2,1,1))
for (i in 1:12) {
    plot(ab[,i], aber$ages$Depth, type="l", ann=FALSE)
    segments(x0=rep(0, nrow(ab)), y0=aber$ages$Depth, x1=ab[,i],
        col=ifelse(bp[,i] > 0, 2, 1))
    title(main=colnames(ab)[i])
}
par(opar)
```

The following data set is from the **optpart** package (Roberts 2016b):
vascular plant species cover for the Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA.
We will try to find species associated with different elevations.

First we try a Binomial model for 0/1 data. Note that we set the `try_error` option to `TRUE` so the function will not stop when it runs into an error.

```{r fig.height=8,fig.width=6}
library(optpart)

data(shoshsite)
data(shoshveg)

elev <- cut(shoshsite$elevation, breaks=c(0, 7200, 8000, 9000, 20000))
levels(elev) <- c("low","mid1","mid2", "high")

sveg <- as.matrix(shoshveg)
sveg[sveg > 0] <- 1
o <- opticut(sveg ~ 1, strata=elev, dist="binomial")
plot(o, sort=1, mar=c(4,6,2,2), cex.axis=0.5, ylab="")
```

Next, we use the same data set as percent cover data and specify a Beta distribution:

```{r}
sveg <- as.matrix(shoshveg)
sveg <- sveg[,colSums(sveg>0) >= 50]
table(sveg)
sveg[sveg==0] <- 0.001
sveg[sveg==0.1] <- 0.01
sveg[sveg==0.5] <- 0.05
sveg[sveg==1] <- 0.15
sveg[sveg==2] <- 0.25
sveg[sveg==3] <- 0.35
sveg[sveg==4] <- 0.45
sveg[sveg==5] <- 0.55
sveg[sveg==6] <- 0.65
sveg[sveg==7] <- 0.75
sveg[sveg==8] <- 0.8
table(sveg)
o2 <- opticut(sveg ~ 1, strata=elev, dist="beta")
plot(o2, sort=1, mar=c(4,6,2,2), cex.axis=0.6, ylab="")
```


## Presence-only (use-availability) data

Presence only data is a result from animal movement studies, or based on museum specimens. Here is an example of Mountain Goat telemetry data that were collected in the Coast Mountains of northwest British Columbia, Canada, as described in Lele and Keim (2006).

Multiple species analysis is not possible due to different number of used (presence) points for each species. It leads to a ragged-array format which is not straightforward to supply through the formula interface. The analysis of such presence-only data is also subject to conditions as explained by Solymos & Lele (2016).

According to our expectations, Mountain Goats are associated with steeper slopes:

```{r}
library(ResourceSelection)
data(goats)
slp <- cut(goats$SLOPE,c(0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 90), include.lowest=TRUE)
table(slp, goats$STATUS)
o <- opticut(STATUS ~ ELEVATION, data=goats, strata=slp, dist="rsf")
o$species
plot(o, sort=FALSE, show_S=FALSE)
```

## Customizing the distribution

Me may want to expand the Zero-inflation component in a ZIP model.
So instead of a constant zero probability, we may want to include covariate effects to account for some variation in the counts.
See how the return value needs to be structured when supplying a function as distribution.

```{r}
data(dolina)
dolina$samp$stratum <- as.integer(dolina$samp$stratum)
Y <- dolina$xtab[,colSums(dolina$xtab > 0) >= 20]

fun <- function(Y, X, linkinv, zi_term, ...) {
    X <- as.matrix(X)
    mod <- pscl::zeroinfl(Y ~ X-1 | zi_term, dist = "poisson", ...)
    list(coef=coef(mod),
        logLik=logLik(mod),
        linkinv=mod$linkinv)
}
Xdol <- model.matrix(~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp)
fun(Y[,"amin"], Xdol, zi_term=dolina$samp$method)
opticut1(Y[,"amin"], Xdol, Z=dolina$samp$mhab,
    dist=fun, zi_term=dolina$samp$method)
dol2 <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist=fun, zi_term=dolina$samp$method)
summary(dol2)
```


### Mixed-effects models (LMM, GLMM)

Here is an example using mixed models and the package **lme4** (Bates et al. 2015) with the dolina data. Pairs of samples were taken at each sampling location using 2 methods. The `mwthod` is now a fixed factor, while location is a random intercept (see Kemencei et al. 2014 for more explanation).

```{r}
library(lme4)
lmefun <- function(Y, X, linkinv, gr, ...) {
    X <- as.matrix(X)
    m <- glmer(Y ~ X-1 + (1|gr), family=poisson("log"), ...)
    list(coef=fixef(m),
        logLik=logLik(m),
        linkinv=family(m)$linkinv)
}
lmefun(Y[,1], X=matrix(1, nrow(Y), 1), gr=dolina$samp$sample)

o <- opticut(Y[,"dper"] ~ method, data=dolina$samp, strata=dolina$samp$mhab, 
    dist=lmefun, gr=dolina$samp$sample)
print(o$species[[1]], cut=-Inf)
```

### Generalized additive models (GAM)

We will use the `gam` function from the **mgcv** package (Wood 2006)
and data of Ovenbird survey counts from Solymos et al. (2012).

First off, we define the function:

```{r}
library(mgcv)
library(detect)
data(oven)
oven$veg <- factor(NA, c("open","decid","conif"))
oven$veg[oven$pforest < 0.5] <- "open"
oven$veg[oven$pforest >= 0.5 & oven$pdecid >= 0.5] <- "decid"
oven$veg[oven$pforest >= 0.5 & oven$pdecid < 0.5] <- "conif"
table(oven$veg, useNA="always")
oven$xlat <- scale(oven$lat)
oven$xlong <- scale(oven$long)
gamfun <- function(Y, X, linkinv, Data, ...) {
    X <- as.matrix(X)
    m <- mgcv::gam(Y ~ X-1 + s(xlat) + s(xlong), Data, ...)
    list(coef=coef(m),
        logLik=logLik(m),
        linkinv=family(m)$linkinv)
}
```

Try it on a single partition: agriculture vs. not:

```{r}
x <- ifelse(oven$veg=="agr",1,0)
X <- model.matrix(~x)
gamfun(oven$count, X, Data=oven, family=poisson)
print(opticut1(oven$count, X=X[,1,drop=FALSE], oven$veg, dist=gamfun,
    Data=oven, family=poisson), cut=-Inf)
```

Poisson count example with GAM:

```{r}
o <- opticut(count ~ 1, oven, strata=veg, dist=gamfun, Data=oven, family=poisson)
summary(o)
o <- opticut(count ~ 1, oven, strata=veg, dist="poisson")
summary(o)
```

Binomial GAM:

```{r}
oven$pa <- ifelse(oven$count > 0, 1, 0)
o <- opticut(pa ~ 1, oven, strata=veg, dist=gamfun, Data=oven, family=binomial)
summary(o)
o <- opticut(pa ~ 1, oven, strata=veg, dist="binomial")
summary(o)
```


### Incorporating detectability: N-mixture models

A single-visit based N-mixture is an example where
detection error is estimated (Solymos et al. 2012, Solymos & Lele 2016).
We will use the Ovenbird data from the **detect** package (Solymos et al. 2016).

```{r}
svfun <- function(Y, X, linkinv, ...) {
    X <- as.matrix(X)
    m <- detect::svabu(Y ~ X-1 | Xdet-1, ...)
    list(coef=coef(m),
        logLik=logLik(m),
        linkinv=poisson()$linkinv)
}
## detection model
oven$xjulian <- scale(oven$julian)
Xdet <- model.matrix(~ xjulian, oven)
svfun(oven$count, X=model.matrix(~ xlat + xlong, oven))
```

Let us compare results
based on naive GLM and N-mixture:

```{r}
## naive GLM
o1 <- opticut(count ~ xlat + xlong, oven, strata=veg, dist="poisson")
print(o1$species[[1]], cut=-Inf)
## N-mixture
summary(svabu(count ~ xlat + veg | xjulian, data=oven))
o2 <- opticut(count ~ xlat + xlong, oven, strata=veg, dist=svfun)
print(o2$species[[1]], cut=-Inf)
```

# Package options

## High performance computing

```{r warning=FALSE}
data(dolina)
dolina$samp$stratum <- as.integer(dolina$samp$stratum)
Y <- ifelse(dolina$xtab > 0, 1, 0)
dol <- opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="binomial")

## parallel computing comparisons
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(2)

## sequential, all combinations (2^(K-1) - 1)
system.time(opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="binomial", comb="all", cl=NULL))

## sequential, rank based combinations (K - 1)

system.time(opticut(Y ~ stratum + lmoist + method, data=dolina$samp,
    strata=dolina$samp$mhab, dist="binomial", comb="rank", cl=cl))

## compare timings for uncertainty calculations
system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="asymp", B=999))
system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="asymp", B=999, cl=cl))

system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="boot", B=4))
system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="boot", B=4, cl=cl))

system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="multi", B=4))
system.time(uncertainty(dol, type="multi", B=4, cl=cl))

stopCluster(cl)
```

## Global options

The `ocoptions` function provides a convenient way of handling options 
related to the **opticut** package.
The function takes arguments in `<tag> = <value>` form, or a list of tagged values.
The tags must come from the parameters described below.
When parameters are set by `ocoptions`, their former values are
returned in an invisible named list. Such a list can be passed as an
argument to `ocoptions` to restore the parameter values.
Tags are the following:

* `collapse`: character value to be used when merging factor levels,
  the default is `"+"`.
* `cut`: log likelihood ratio value, model/species with lower
  values are excluded from summaries and plots,
  the default is `2`.
* `sort`: logical value indicating if species/partitions
  should be meaningfully sorted, the default is `TRUE`.
  It can take numeric value when only species (`1`)
  or partitions (`2`) are to be sorted (`1:2` is equivalent to
  `TRUE`, wile any other numeric value is equivalent to `FALSE`).
* `theme`: the color theme to be used based on `occolors`,
  the default is `"br"`.
* `check_comb`: check the design matrices for complementary partitions
  using `checkComb`,
  the default is `TRUE`.
* `try_error`: if `opticut` should `try` to exclude
  species where the models failed (`TRUE`), the default
  is to stop when an error is encountered (`FALSE`).
* `scale`: the scaling factor used to calculate indicator value (`I`)
  based on the estimated coefficient (b): `I = abs(tanh(b*scale))`,
  the default is `0.5`.

## http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384719-5.00430-5
gr <- as.factor(paste0("X", rep(1:5, each=5)))
spp <- cbind(Species1=rep(c(4,6,5,3,2), each=5),
    Species2=c(rep(c(8,4,6), each=5), 4,4,2, rep(0,7)),
    Species3=rep(c(18,2,0,0,0), each=5))
rownames(spp) <- gr

## current settings
str(ocoptions()) # these give identical answers
str(getOption("ocoptions"))
summary(ocall <- opticut(spp ~ 1, strata=gr, dist="gaussian", comb="all"))

## resetting pboptions and checking new settings
ocop <- ocoptions(collapse="&", sort=FALSE)
str(ocoptions())
## running again with new settings
summary(ocall <- opticut(spp ~ 1, strata=gr, dist="gaussian", comb="all"))

## resetting original
ocoptions(ocop)
str(ocoptions())
```

## Color themes

The **opticut** package uses color themes for plotting and 
provides a convenient way of setting color palettes via the `occolors` function.
The function takes a single `theme` argument and returns a function as
in `colorRampPalette`.

The `theme` argument can be a character value, character vector, or a function used to interpolate the colors. The built-in values are `"br"` (blue-red divergent palette, colorblind safe),
`"gr"` (green-red divergent palette), `"bw"` (black and white).
Hexadecimal values for the built-in palettes are taken from [http://colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/).

```{r}
plot(1:100, rep(2, 100), pch = 15,
    ylim = c(0, 21), axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE,
    col = occolors()(100)) # default 'bg'
text(50, 1, "theme = 'br'")
points(1:100, rep(5, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors("gr")(100))
text(50, 4, "theme = 'gr'")
points(1:100, rep(8, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors("bw")(100))
text(50, 7, "theme = 'bw'")
points(1:100, rep(11, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors(terrain.colors)(100))
text(50, 10, "theme = terrain.colors")
points(1:100, rep(14, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors(c("purple", "pink", "orange"))(100))
text(50, 13, "theme = c('purple', 'pink', 'orange')")
points(1:100, rep(17, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors(c("#a6611a", "#ffffbf", "#018571"))(100))
text(50, 16, "theme = c('#a6611a', '#ffffbf', '#018571')")
points(1:100, rep(20, 100), pch = 15,
    col=occolors(c("#7b3294", "#ffffbf", "#008837"))(100))
text(50, 19, "theme = c('#7b3294', '#ffffbf', '#008837')")
```

## Progress bar

The expected completion time of extensive calculations and the
progress is shown by the progress bar via the **pbapply** package.
Default options with **opticut** are:

```{r}
str(pboptions())
```

See `?pboptions` for a description of these options. Use `pboptions(type = "none")` to turn off the progress bar in interactive R sessions. The progress bar is automatically turned off during non-interactive sessions.

## Dynamic documents

**opticut** object summaries come with an `as.data.frame` method that can be used
to turn the summary into a data frame, which is what for example the
`kable` function from **knitr** package expects. This way, formatting the
output is much facilitated, and the user does not have to dig into the
structure of the summary object.

The GitHub repository has a minimal [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) example do demonstrate how to format **opticut** objects for best effects: [Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psolymos/opticut/master/extras/opticut-knitr-example.Rmd) source, knitted [PDF](https://github.com/psolymos/opticut/raw/master/extras/opticut-knitr-example.pdf).

```{r}
library(knitr)

y <- cbind(
    Sp1=c(4,6,3,5, 5,6,3,4, 4,1,3,2),
    Sp2=c(0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,1, 4,2,3,4),
    Sp3=c(0,0,3,0, 2,3,0,5, 5,6,3,4))
g <-    c(1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3)
oc <- opticut(formula = y ~ 1, strata = g, dist = "poisson")
uc <- uncertainty(oc, type = "asymp", B = 999)

print(kable(as.data.frame(oc), digits=3))
print(kable(oc$species[[1]][,c(1,2,4,5,8,9,10)], digits=3))
print(kable(as.data.frame(uc), digits=3))
```

The `kable` output is rendered as nice tables (without the `print` part):

```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(oc), digits=3)
kable(oc$species[[1]][,c(1,2,4,5,8,9,10)], digits=3)
kable(as.data.frame(uc), digits=3)
```

# Summary

The likelihood-based optimal partitioning framework implemented in the opticut R package provides a compelling alternative to other available R packages (**indicspecies**, De Caceres & Legendre 2009; **labdsv** and **optpart**, Roberts 2016a, 2016b; **vegan**, Oksanen et al. 2016), especially when the type of data or the presence of modifying effects call for an alternative approach. 

The package comes with many parametric models included for binary, count, abundance, percent cover, ordinal, and presence-only data, and the approach can be extended to more complex situations, such as mixed models, additive models. The opticut package leverages other R packages (**MASS**, Venables & Ripley 2002; **betareg**, Cribari-Neto & Zeileis 2010; **pscl**, Zeileis et al. 2008; **ResourceSelection**, Lele et al. 2016) for fitting parametric models. The approach can be extended to linear and generalized linear mixed models (LMM, GLMM; see Kemencei et al. 2014), generalized additive models, N-mixture models.

Computing times are shortened by the application of efficient algorithms and through high performance computing options. The **opticut** package provides progress bars with estimated remaining time for long-running evaluations (through the **pbapply** package, Solymos & Zawadzki 2016), natively supports several parallel back-ends (multicore machines, computing clusters, forking; through the **parallel** package, R Core Team 2016) to speed calculations up, and provides options and methods for dynamic report generation (coercion methods and color themes). Functions in the package can be customized and extended to meet the needs under a wide range of real-world situations.

Description: Likelihood based optimal partitioning for indicator
  species analysis. Finding the best binary partition for each species
  based on model selection, possibly controlling for modifying/confounding
  variables as described in Kemencei et al. (2014) <doi:10.1556/ComEc.15.2014.2.6>.
  The package also implements various measures of uncertainty based on
  binary and multinomial partitions, exploratory
  suitability indices, Lorenz-curve based thresholding,
  with native support for parallel computations.

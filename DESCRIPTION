Description: Likelihood based optimal partitioning and indicator
  species analysis. Finding the best binary partition for each species
  based on model selection, with the possibility to take into account
  modifying/confounding variables as described
  in Kemencei et al. (2014) <doi:10.1556/ComEc.15.2014.2.6>.
  The package implements binary and multi-level response models,
  various measures of uncertainty, Lorenz-curve based thresholding,
  with native support for parallel computations.
